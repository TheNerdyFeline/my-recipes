# Wellons Biscuits

* 500g (~4c) of all purpose flour 
* 4tsp baking powder
* 2tsp salt
* 1c (2 sticks) butter
* 1.25c buttermilk

1. Unwrap butter and place in freezer for 30-60 minutes. 
2. Thoroughly mix dry ingredients in a large bowl using a whisk. Chilling the dry ingredients in the fridge while the butter is freezing can help with forming the biscuits later.
3. When the butter is ready, begin pre-heating oven to 410F. Shred the cold butter into the large bowl, tossing in the flour with a fork as needed to keep the butter from sticking to itself.
4. Using a spatula, slowly combine buttermilk into the large bowl until the flour is just barely absorbed. If a bit more liquid is needed, but not enough buttermilk is available or prepared, water is fine. Better to use too little liquid than too much since more can be added later.
5. Empty crumbly bowl contents onto lightly-floured countertop, squeeze together into a dough, then roll out like a pie crust. Cut in half and stack. Cut in half again and stack. Roll out the stack and repeat rolling and cutting several times to build layers. Sprinkle flour on the countertop and dough as needed to prevent sticking. Finally work into a 1-inch thick square, cut into 16 equal smaller squares, place squares on parchment paper on a baking sheet.
6. Bake for 18 minutes. Broil an additional 1 minute to crisp the edges.
7. Move baked biscuits to cooling rack to allow excess moisture to escape. Let rest for a few minutes, then dig in. The biscuits keep for at least several days in a sealed container.

Substitutes:

Buttermilk: If lacking buttermilk, stir 1tbsp of vinegar per cup of milk  and let sit
for at least 10-15 minutes. Lacking milk, powdered milk works well. In
the worst case water also works, but the biscuits will be slightly less
flavorful.

Add Flavor

Orange - replace part of buttermilk with zest and juice of one medium orange, about 1/3 cup.
