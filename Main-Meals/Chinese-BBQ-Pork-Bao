# Chinese BBQ Pork Bao 

## For the Dough
* 5 1/3 cups flour (bread or all purpose, divided)
* 2/3 cup water
* 1 1/3 cup milk (divided)
* 1/3 cup sugar
* 1 tsp Salt
* 4 tsp Instant Yeast
* 2 Eggs
* 4 tbsp Butter (melted)
* Egg wash (1 egg beaten with 1 tbsp of milk)
* 1 tbsp Sesame Seeds (optional)


## For the Filling
* 2 tbsp Oil
* 1/2 cup Shallots or Onion finely shopped
* 2 tbsp Sugar
* 1 1/2 tbsp Soy Sauce
* 2 tbsp Oyster Sauce
* 2 tsp Sesame Oil
* 2 tsp Dark Soy Sauce
* 3/4 cup Chicken Stock
* 3 tbsp Flour
* 2 Cups Char Siu (Chinese Roasted Pork, divided)


1. In medium sauce pan, mix 1/3 cup flour with 2/3 cup water and 1/3 cup milk until the flour is dissolved. Put the pan over medium heat and stir constantly until the mixture resembles a thick paste, about 3-5 min. Set aside.

2. In large mixing bowl, combine 5 cups of flour, sugar, and yeast. Add the flour paste (tangzhong), 1 cup milk, 2 eggs, and melted butter. Stir together to form a soft dough, and knead (by hand or with dough hook attachment of your mixer) for 15-20 min. Form dough into a ball and place in a lightly greased bowl. Cover with damp cloth, and let rise for 1 hour.

3. While the dough rises, make the meat filling. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a wok over medium high heat. Add the onion and stir-fry for 2 min. Add sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and dark soy. Stir and cook until it started to bubble up. Add the chicken stock and flour.

4. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook, stirring, for a couple minutes until thickened. Remove from the heat and stir in the Char Siu. Set aside to cool.

5. After the dough has risen, separate it into 16 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a small circle, where the center is slightly thicker than the edges. Fill each with meat filling, and crimp them closed, making sure they're tightly sealed. Lay them out seam side down on baking sheets lined with parchment paper, and let rise for another hour.

6. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 C). Brush the egg wash, sprinkle with sesame seeds (if using). Put them in the oven and immediately turn the oven down from 400 to 350 degrees F (about 175 C). Bake for 25 min, or until golden brown.
