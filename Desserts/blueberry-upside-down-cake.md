# Blueberry Upside Down Cake

* 6 Tbsp butter, softened, divided
* 1/4 Brown Sugar
* 2 1/2 Cups Blueberries
* 3/4 Cup Granulated Sugar
* 1 Egg
* 1/2 Tsp Vanilla Extract
* 1 1/4 Cups Cake Flour
* 1 1/2 Tsp Baking Powder
* 1/2 Whole Milk
* Whipped Topping (optional)

1. Preheat oven to 350 F. Melt 2 Tbsp butter in small saucepan, and stir in brown sugar. Spread evenly in the bottom of an 8X3 in pan or baking dish. Layer blueberries evenly on top of the brown sugar mixture.
2. Combine flour and baking powder, set aside. Cream remaining butter, 4 Tbsp, and granulated sugar until fluffy. Beat in egg and vanilla. Add flour mixture to the creamed mixture alternating with milk. Beat well.
3. Pour batter over blueberries, and bake for about 40 min, or until done. Immediately invert on serving platter. Server with whipped topping.

## Variations
* You could probably substitute any berry such as blackberries, although I have not tested it myself.

## Substitutes
* Instead of whole milk, you can use 2%, 1%, or skim depending on what you have on hand
* Soy Milk for a Non-dairy option (almond milk is too thin)
