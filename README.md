# My Favorite Recipes

I am saving all my favorite recipes from various cookbooks and websites here for easy access. I will try to add the source for each recipe at the bottom, and you can also see my variations on those recipes. I like to add different flavors to my baked goods. I also don't like black pepper, so I replaced black pepper in all recipes with cumin.
